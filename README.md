# Machine-learning-tutorial
In this tutorial I have tried to show you some common and useful methods of machine learning field such as regression, classification, clustering and recommendation systems. Of course there a lot more to learn and utilize, but this would be a good start for you as a beginner.
Note that there three brief and short notebooks about Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib which help you to get more familiar with these tools. But for more information learn each one of them separately.
I suggest you to see regression at first, and then classification and clustering after that and finally recommendation systems at the end.
